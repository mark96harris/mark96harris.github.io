### Work Experience
**Data Scientist/Optical Analyst @ Leidos/AFRL (_November 2018 - August 2023_)**
- Utilized atmospheric simulation software to model complex adaptive optics telescope systems.
- Demonstrated expertise in machine and deep learning, particularly in neural network hyperparameter optimization, yielding improved Signal/Noise ratios in simulated and real optical transmission paths under turbulent atmospheric conditions
- Personally invested over 5 years in research, employing statistics, feature engineering, and machine learning to achieve 98% accurate forecasting of turbulence-induced wavefronts multiple time steps into the future. Utilized GPU clusters for predictive analytics, resulting in a 200% increase in Signal/Noise and expanded control loop bandwidth for real and simulated data

**Systems Engineer @ Booz Allen Hamilton (_March 2016 - October 2018_)**
- Directed efforts in DoD Directed Energy software (HELCOMES, HELEEOS, ETB, etc.) for simulating optical transmission of high-power laser light through dynamic atmospherics, along with proficiency in High Power Radio and Microwave interactions (JREM) and size, weight, power, and thermal management models for High Energy Laser systems, including hybrid gas/fiber lasers (DPAL)
- Conducted extensive validation and verification efforts for DOD/DOE requested software suites, executing diverse simulation scenarios to assess physics-based results; compared outcomes against established analytical equations, unveiling errors for enhancement opportunities

**Research Engineer @ EMRTCL (_January 2012 - February 2016_)**
- Orchestrated testing and conducted extensive research on diverse energetic material platforms
- Directed the formulation and successful execution of comprehensive testing programs, encompassing large-scale detonations, gun systems, simulant dispersion, warhead penetration, and ballistic imaging
- Demonstrated technical prowess by authoring persuasive bids and proposals, crafting illustrative test layouts, allocating resources, and designing custom technical parts

|Figure a,| A very dense plot showing how we have combined 6 variables of our experimental results showing that AO can increase quantum channel efficiencies by more that 10 dB while spacially filtering daytime background light at the diffraction limit.  This plot is using 1 x HV 5/7 turbulence profile, Open/Closed Loop Adaptive Optics, Strehl ratio, r~o~ spacial coherence, rho^2^ scintillation index - all important atmospheric turbulence parameters.|
