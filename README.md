### Work Experience
** Data Scientist/Optical Analyst @ Leidos/AFRL (_November 2018 - August 2023_)**
- Utilized atmospheric simulation software to model complex adaptive optics telescope systems.
- Demonstrated expertise in machine and deep learning, particularly in neural network hyperparameter optimization, yielding improved Signal/Noise ratios in simulated and real optical transmission paths under turbulent atmospheric conditions
- Personally invested over 5 years in research, employing statistics, feature engineering, and machine learning to achieve 98% accurate forecasting of turbulence-induced wavefronts multiple time steps into the future. Utilized GPU clusters for predictive analytics, resulting in a 200% increase in Signal/Noise and expanded control loop bandwidth for real and simulated data
